The first reason is that when you push your brain to learn challenging things such as language, skills, and more the brain is able to develop to new levels that was not done before. Another reason is that the brain is forced to make connections when placed in challenging environments. The brain thus develops because it fosters connections. As these connections grow, the brain becomes stronger and more capable of deductive reasoning. Our brains welcome challenge because that is the reason continuous development is made possible.

For example, those with fixed mindset often believe that intelligence is fixed and that hard work and acceptance of challenge will not change the outcome. They strongly believe there isn't much that can be done to culture the brain into a more complex and capable one. As a result, they often do not rise up to the challenge because they feel that the challenge will not play any benefit for them.

If a person knows that he is naturally talented at something, he or she will possess the confidence necessary to overcome discouragement. I believe that those with the ""growth mindset"" are more willing to rise to the challenge and foster their growth. With their believe that the brain becomes stronger through exercise (like muscles), they are more willing to pursue goals that may seem far fetched. at the same time, such mindset can also discourage when one person sees another excelling more at something.

These neurons essentially carry the important information that is relayed to the brain through the various lobes. For example, in the temporary lobe, hearing is relayed from the ears to the brain, and it is through the neurons, and in turn, through the dendrites that connect and transfer this information to the frontal lobe to be used in memory and other brain activity.

I know that you think the brain is a total mystery and that people don't know anything about it. However, I am writing this letter to inform you that this idea of yours is actually false, and that many people, in fact, do know much about the brain, including me. In fact, I want to tell you what I personally have just learned about the brain. /  / First of all, the brain is separated into various lobes. The brain is still one organ, but with various parts to it internally. Much like a house is one structure, even though there are many rooms inside it with various functions, the brain is one organ with many different functions. But before I begin talking about these individual functions, I want to first introduce neurons to you. You do know that cells are the essential unit to humans. In the brain, these special cells called neurons carry information and all the data that allows us to be who we are and think what we think. These neurons are carried through dendrites. The neuron relay chain is shaped much like the branches of a tree. These branches are called dendrites, which is ""branches"" in Greek. These dendrites then touch other dendrites and relay information to other parts of the body. Now that this has been introduced, I want to tell you about the different functions of the brain. The human brain is relatively large compared to those of other animals. The frontal lobe is in the front, and is responsible for all the ""thinking"" we do, such as decision making, critical thinking, and the storage of long-term memory. The parietal lobes are responsible for our teaching. When our hands stroke soft fabric, we don't automatically know that the fabric is soft. Instead, the texture is relayed as information in neurons through dendrites to the rest of our brain, and in the parietal lobe, this information is then converted into a texture that we are familiar with. Thus, without the parietal lobe, we wouldn't have any feeling. The occipital lobe is responsible for sight, and is located in the back of our head. Our eyes are actually seeing things very blurry. When the light enters our eyes, it is then relayed through nerves to our brain's occipital lobes. It is then that our brain is able to identify the light and objects that entered our eyes and transform them into sight and objects that we can distinguish and recognize. Thus, even if your eyes are working fine, if you don't have a proper occipital lobe, chances are that you won't be able to see anything. The temporal lobe is responsible for our hearing, and much like the other lobes in our brain, transform and identfity the information in the form of neurons that first enter our brain through the ears. /  / As you can see, there is so much information about the brain. I only relayed to you a tad bit of what I learned just now; there is so much more that can still be learned! /  / Sincerely, / Your Friend Kyeihong",17.878,17.878,1028.674,1,1,1,4,509,79,1,7,3,2,4,3,6,6,5,6,6,6,3,5,3,3,5,2,6,4,6,6,"The article regarding the brain was trying to communicate how humans think.

The occiupital lobe allows you to process visuals and see. The Parietal lobe allows you to understand information and process spacial aspects.

For practice, I had a coach that taught me the fundamentals--how to grip the club, where to focus my eyes, how to position my feet, how to turn properly, etc. I would practice for an hour or two each day, going over the fundamentals until everything became clear. I'd go to the driving range to hit balls and experiment with different strategies. Sometimes I'd put my feet farther forward, sometimes a little farther back. Sometimes I'd grip the club slightly different until I found something that truly worked. I ended up playing golf for years, but it took months and months of dedication and persistence to get good. I took what I learned on the driving range and put it to use on the course. If I made mistakes, I made note of what I did wrong and then I tried my best to correct them. I kept all my scorecards, and if my scores weren't improving regularly, I'd figure out what I needed to change. It was mostly a lengthy trial and error period but eventually I kept playing and got better and better. Just becoming so used to swinging a club helped immensely.

The occipital lobe deals with vision; damage to the lobe could lead to blindness, even if your eyes are working fine.

What you must know about the brain is that it is the most important organ in our body, for it serves as the mastermind behind all our actions, thoughts, feelings, and every other thing you can think of. Our ability to plan out schedules or study concepts for an upcoming test can be attributed to the many different parts of the brain working in harmony with one another. Our sense of smell, touch, hearing, memory retention, sight, and so forth, are only feasible because our brains contain millions of little neurons which transmit electrical signals via dendrites and axons that connect these neurons. After acknowledging the many vital bodily functions that are possible because the brain is what it is, we can infer that any minor damage to such a delicate, cohesive structure can result in serious damage. For example, imagine if you got into a car accident which led to a serious head injury.

Believe it or not, you are not the only one who has ever struggled in school.

What separates those kids that end up being successful in life is that they are able to overcome those difficulties. They do this by working harder than everyone else. / I recently read an article about how our brains work. The article talked about the brain is a muscle, and so it has potential to grow bigger and stronger just like any other muscle. There is always potential to be 'smarter', but in order to do this, one must invest the time and effort. The most effective way is to develop a good strategy (depending on what particular aspects of school you are struggling in) and then spend the time to practice and challenge yourself. / In this way, you can make yourself 'smarter' - you just have to put in the time and effort. The 'smart' kids in school aren't successful because they were naturally born with a high IQ or anything, they are able to achieve high grades because they have the determination and persistence to consistently put in the time and effort required to improve their brains and achieve success.

Our brains can be divided into four sections, or lobes.  They are the Frontal, Parietal, Occipital, and Temporal lobes. The frontal lobe is located in the front (Frontal, front, makes sense right?) of your brain.  It handles things like basic motor skills, and controls your judgement and emotions.The temporal lobe is located on the side of your brain, near your ears and temples (Temporal, temples, you get it?). The temporal lobe is in charge of your memory and hearing.  The Occipital lobe is located in the back of your brain and controls vision (Occipital, optics, they sound somewhat similar).  Lastly the parietal lobe is located on top of your brain and it integrates sensory input from touching and feeling, so you can figure out what you're touching and feeling (unfortunately, i haven't been able to determine any obvious mnemonics to assist you in remembering the location or tasks of the parietal lobe).  One thing i want you to understand is that damage to a lobe makes it difficult to complete its tasks adequately.  So if you fall backwards and hit the back of your head and damage your occipital lobe, you might suddenly find it very difficult to see. If you're jumping on the bed and you still haven't gotten off even though your mom told you to, and consequently you smash your head on the ceiling, you might find it difficult to feel things from then on due to damage to your parietal lobe. As you can see, it is very important to keep your brain safe as it does a lot for you.
